# Jenga Challenge

After reading the book "The Adventure Challenge... In Bed", I decided to tweak it the Jenga challenge a little.

Click on the green button code on top right corner, download zip, unzip it on your computer, double click on the "index.html" file and follow the instructions.

You will need a Jenga game and two chopsticks.

Have fun with this little increment, feel free to contribute if you have other ideas!
