# Jenga Challenge

After reading the book "The Adventure Challenge... In Bed", I decided to tweak and improve the Jenga challenge.

Click on the green button code on top right corner, download zip, unzip it on your computer, double click on the "index.html" file and follow the instructions.

You will need a Jenga game and two chopsticks.

Have fun with this little increment, feel free to contribute if you have other ideas!
